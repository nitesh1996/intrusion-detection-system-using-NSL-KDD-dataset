Final year university project.

Internet of Things (IoT) - IoT is the next evolution of the internet, where almost all the
devices have the ability to connect to the internet. With the increasing demand, advancement
in the technology and growth within the IoT automated network system, the IoT models have
become more complex. IoT devices use a wireless medium to broadcast data which makes
them become a major target for the attack..

Machine learning - As attack vectors and threats evolve, traditional security techniques are
becoming inefficient and ineffective in addressing the problem of IoT security, as they are
unable to update themselves to detect new threats, opening the door for new types of
intrusion detection systems based on machine learning and artificial neural networks
concepts.
